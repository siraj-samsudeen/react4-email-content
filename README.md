CodingWith-Adam/tdd-with-react: TDD with react
https://github.com/CodingWith-Adam/tdd-with-react

- very good video - took a simple counter function and used tests to build it without ever launching the UI till the very end
- A very good reference video to pass it to other React dev to show how TDD looks like.
- I liked that he uses a wireframe and clear instructions for the features expected.

- uses enzyme, which looks a bit different and seems more friendly than testing-library. Not sure why testing-library is considered better
- towards the end, he does 2 refactoring to show that the tests protects us #Wonderful - for this piece alone, this video is worth watching
